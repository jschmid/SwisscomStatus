# What is Swisscom Status?
It is an Android application that uses the "status" service from Swisscom to check the remaining SMS/Data credit of a data plan.

# How does it work?

It sends a SMS to the regular 444 number and waits for a response. It then parses the response and tries to find the information.

# I want a widget!

Me too :)
